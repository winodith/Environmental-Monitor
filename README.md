# Environmental Monitor

This project uses a DHT22 sensor and a soil moisture sensor to monitor environmental conditions. The system also includes two LEDs to provide visual feedback based on temperature and soil moisture levels.

## Components Used:
- DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Green LED (Pin 9)
- Red LED (Pin 10)

## Functionality:
- The DHT22 sensor measures temperature and humidity.
- The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture level in the soil.
- The green LED remains on when the system is active.
- The red LED turns on when the temperature exceeds 30Â°C and the soil moisture level is below 300, indicating hot and dry conditions.

## Wiring Diagram:
- DHT22: Pin 2
- Soil Moisture Sensor: Pin A0
- Green LED: Pin 9
- Red LED: Pin 10
